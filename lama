    LAMA - Location Aware Movement API - 2013 Sangar

    This program is licensed under the MIT license.
    http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php

    The API will keep track of the turtle's position and facing, even across
    multiple games: the state is persistent. In particular it is very robust,
    i.e. even if the turtle is currently moving when it is forced to shut down
    because its chunk is unloaded, the coordinates will always be correct after
    it resumes. In theory, anyways. It's the only actually working approach I'm
    aware of, using the turtle's fuel level to check if it moved in such cases.

    The API is relatively basic, in that it is purely focused on movement. It's
    essentially a rich drop-in replacement for the the original navigational
    functions in the turtle API:
        turtle.forward   -> lama.forward
        turtle.back      -> lama.back
        turtle.up        -> lama.up
        turtle.down      -> lama.down
        turtle.turnRight -> lama.turnRight
        turtle.turnLeft  -> lama.turnLeft

    When using this API, you must not use any other functions that alter
    the turtle's position or facing. In particular:

        DO NOT USE turtle.forward, turtle.back, turtle.up, turtle.down,
        turtle.turnRight or turtle.turnLeft NOR THEIR NATIVE EQUIVALENTS.

    Any other external force changing the turtle's position will also
    invalidate the coordinates, of course (such as the player pickaxing the
    turtle and placing it somewhere else or RP2 frames).

    The utility function lama.hijackTurtleAPI() can be used to override the
    original turtle API functions, to make it easier to integrate this API into
    existing programs.
    When starting a new program it is recommended using the functions directly
    though, to make full use of their capabilities (in particular automatically
    clearing the way). See the function's documentation for more information.

    For example: a call to turtle.forward(1) will return false if the turtle is
